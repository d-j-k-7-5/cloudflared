## UNRELEASED

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- none

### New Features

- [Cloudflare One Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/warp-to-tunnel) specific commands
  now show up in the `cloudflared tunnel route --help` output.

### Improvements

- Nested commands, such as `cloudflared tunnel run`, now consider CLI arguments even if they appear earlier on the
  command. For instance, `cloudflared --config config.yaml tunnel run` will now behave the same as
  `cloudflared tunnel --config config.yaml run`
- Warnings are now shown in the output logs whenever cloudflared is running without the most recent version and
  `no-autoupdate` is `true`.
- Access tokens are now stored per Access App instead of per request path.


### Bug Fixes

- GitHub [PR #317](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/issues/317) was broken in 2021.2.5 and is now fixed again.


## 2021.2.5

### New Features

- We introduce [Cloudflare One Routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/tutorials/warp-to-tunnel) in
  beta mode. Cloudflare customer can now connect users and private networks with RFC 1918 IP addresses via the
  Cloudflare edge network. Users running Cloudflare WARP client in the same organization can connect to the services
  made available by Argo Tunnel IP routes. Please share your feedback in the GitHub issue tracker.

## 2021.2.4

### Bug Fixes

- Reverts the Improvement released in 2021.2.3 for CLI arguments as it introduced a regression where cloudflared failed
  to read URLs in configuration files.
- cloudflared now logs the reason for failed connections if the error is recoverable.

## 2021.2.3

### Backward Incompatible Changes

- Removes db-connect. The Cloudflare Workers product will continue to support db-connect implementations with versions
  of cloudflared that predate this release and include support for db-connect.

### New Features

- Introduces support for proxy configurations with websockets in arbitrary TCP connections (#318).

### Improvements

- (reverted) Nested command line argument handling.

### Bug Fixes

- The maximum number of upstream connections is now limited by default which should fix reported issues of cloudflared
  exhausting CPU usage when faced with connectivity issues.
